# Adjustable Voltage Regulator Circuit with PCB Design

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design of an adjustable voltage regulator circuit using the **LM317T** IC. The circuit outputs a stable 3.7V DC voltage, suitable for powering low-voltage devices. The schematic and PCB layout were designed using **TINA CAD software**, and the prototype was successfully implemented.

## Features
- Adjustable output voltage using LM317T.
- Efficient ripple reduction with filtering capacitors.
- Compact PCB layout for easy implementation.

## Components Used
- **LM317T**: Voltage regulator IC for adjustable output.
- **Bridge Rectifier**: Converts AC to DC.
- **Capacitors**: For filtering and smoothing ripples.
- **Resistors**: Sets the output voltage in the LM317 circuit.
- **Transformer**: Steps down the input AC voltage.
- **Miscellaneous**: Diodes, switches, and connectors.

## How It Works
1. The transformer steps down the input AC voltage.
2. The bridge rectifier converts AC to pulsating DC.
3. Filter capacitors smooth out voltage ripples.
4. The LM317T regulator provides a stable, adjustable DC output voltage.
5. The output voltage is set to 3.7V using appropriately selected resistors.
